# Regression Analysis Project

A Python-based project for performing **linear and multiple regression analysis**.  
This project demonstrates key concepts in regression, including model fitting, prediction, and evaluation metrics.

## Features

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Predicting a target variable based on a single predictor.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Predicting a target variable using multiple predictors.
- **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots, regression lines, and residual plots.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R²).
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Users can apply regression on their own CSV datasets.
