# Central Limit Theorem Animation

This project visualizes the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** using repeated sampling from a Binomial distribution.  
For different sample sizes, the histogram of sample means gradually approaches a **Normal distribution**, demonstrating the CLT in real time.

### 📌 Features
- Animates convergence to the normal curve  
- Multiple sample sizes (5, 10, 30, 100, 500)  
- Uses scipy, numpy, matplotlib  

### 📦 File  
- `clt_animation.py` — full animation script

### 📊 Concepts Demonstrated
- Law of Large Numbers  
- Central Limit Theorem  
- Sampling distributions
